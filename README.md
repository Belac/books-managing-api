## Getting started
### Installing dependencies
#### Python
First of all, you must have at least **Python 3.10.0** on your computer. 
If not, click [download python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to install the latest version of python for your platform.
#### Pip or another package manager
Secondly, be sure you have a **package manager** installed on your computer. For instance 
pip 22.0.3 from C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.10)
#### Virtual environment
We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
#### Pip dependencies
Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by running :
    '''pip install -r requirements.txt 
    or 
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt'''
